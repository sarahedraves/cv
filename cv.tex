\section{Presentations and Posters}
\begin{jobshort}{\textbf{A Library of Light Curves: A Catalogue of All Known Complex Rotators through K2 and TESS}}{7.30.2025}
Presented at the 2025 Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Abstract: Complex rotators (CRs) are a recently discovered type of young M dwarf star that have unusual light curves, showing periodic behavior that cannot be explained by more typical causes like starspots. Previous studies have focused on identifying CRs and have suffered from a lack of observations over long temporal baselines. In this project, we compiled a data set of previously identified CRs in the literature and their available K2 and TESS light curves. Also using Gaia data, we investigate the similarities between these objects as well as how they change over time. In the multiyear timeframe we looked at (in some cases over a decade), we found CRs changed their complex patterns significantly or lost their complexity entirely. Further analysis of the light curves could yield better insights into the causes of these changes. This data set will be pivotal for others in the field to continue studying this unusual phenomenon.

\begin{jobshort}{\textbf{Reconstructing Cosmic Filaments around Dwarf Galaxies with the Rubin Observatory}}{1.14.2025 \& 12.4.2024}
Presented similar posters at the 245th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in National Harbor, Maryland and at the 41st Semi-Annual Dr. Janet Liou-Mark Honors \& Undergraduate Research Poster Presentation at CUNY New York City College of Technology. \href{https://aas245-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=3B-03-9F-6A-6E-75-01-97-E0-FC-B1-F5-ED-BF-AB-40}{AAS poster link} and \href{https://academicworks.cuny.edu/ny_pubs/1222/}{CUNY poster link}. Abstract: While the largest structures in the universe that make up the cosmic web are known to influence galaxy formation for massive galaxies, the details of which processes and conditions drive the growth of low mass galaxies remain unclear. Dwarf galaxies are particularly sensitive to the environment around them and are thus an ideal way to trace smaller filaments and then investigate how exactly they impact galactic evolution. To accomplish this, we use simulated observations for the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Rubin Observatory, which is expected to discover 20 billion new galaxies with excellent completeness for dwarfs in the nearby universe. We use this data to identify and select low mass galaxies and infer their properties, such as position, redshift stellar mass, and star formation rate. We bin these galaxies by redshift and use DisPerSE, a topological algorithm which we use recursively in a tomographic way, to reconstruct two-dimensional filaments. We then investigate how the properties of the dwarf galaxies are correlated with their proximity to a filament. This pipeline will be applied to upcoming LSST data, where the unprecedented wealth of data promises to unlock deep insights into the details of how the cosmic web drives galaxy evolution.

\begin{jobshort}{\textbf{Examining Galaxy Bulge Regions with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey}}{5.9.2024}
Presented at the 40th Semi-Annual Dr. Janet Liou-Mark Honors \& Undergraduate Research Poster Presentation at CUNY New York City College of Technology. \href{https://academicworks.cuny.edu/ny_pubs/1137/}{Poster link}. Abstract: Nearly all of the ordinary matter in the universe is located in galaxies, which are made up stars, gas, dust, and black holes, and range in size from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light years across. Galaxies come in different shapes, but many of them are spiral shaped, and some of those have a central bulge region that is distinct from the rest of the galactic disk. This project used a large data set of galaxies that had their bulge and disk components separated to see what correlations those fractions of each galaxy have with other galaxy properties, including total stellar mass and redshift. Binned statistics techniques were used to reduce the noise in the data. The relationships between the bulge radius and total mass and the disk radius and total mass showed strong linear correlations. The relationship between bulge to total ratio and total mass showed that the bulge fraction increases with mass dramatically at first and then declines slowly with mass, for both the mass ratio and the luminosity ratio. This information can be used to constrain galaxy formation models to learn more about how the universe came to be as it is today.
